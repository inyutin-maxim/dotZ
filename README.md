#### dotZ - Next generation dependency management toolkit
Keep features independent and application configurable with dotZ
* ReSharper extension for incremental dependencies analysis
* IOC auto-discovery integration for configuring features at run-time
* Post-compile validation for CI build and ReSharper-less devs

====

### Zone != Dll
Dependencies control in .Net solutions is tightly coupled with deployment control. With dotZ it's no more true.

### Mark namespaces
Meta-class declarations to mark your code with features.

### Declare dependencies
Create derived features and fine-tune 'active' application code.
